Chapter 4 – Error Handling (try / catch)

PDO throws PDOException when an error occurs.

try executes risky code.

catch captures and handles errors.

Never display detailed error messages in production.

Log errors to a file instead of showing them to users.

Exception handling prevents the application from crashing.

✅ Best Practices

Always use prepared statements.

Never trust user input.

Separate connection logic from application logic.

Test SQL queries before running UPDATE or DELETE.

Use logs for debugging, not error messages on screen.
